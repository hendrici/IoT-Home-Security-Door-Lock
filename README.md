# CIS 350 Final Project: Security Lock System

## Description
Safe and secure home entry without the hassle of keys requires the development of a deadbolt whose locking and unlocking is controlled via PIN entry. The possibility of control through a mobile app would make home security easy.

The objective of the product is to provide convenience without sacrificing security. The scope of the proposed solution includes a deadbolt control mechanism, method of confirming user identity via personal identification number, and possible development of wireless connectivity to provide remote access to the lock. The code relating to the mobile application development of the project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/CIS-350/lock_app).

This project is an internet of things (IoT) deadbolt. Containing a LCD display, keypad, and mobile application for additional features. This will allow the user to enter the pin through the onboard keyboard or send the pin through wifi using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Allowing the user to unlock the deadbolt from anywhere in the world along with entering the pin on the device.
