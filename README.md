# A Kinda Simple LaTeX Report Template

After finding a fantastic LaTeX report template (linked above), I discovered it was in fact, a bit too good for my needs. Therefore, I've adapted the original into a template that fit my needs better as an undergrad engineering student. 

If you do not already know how to use LaTeX, I suggest you consult with an external resource to learn the basics before moving forward. Overleaf provides a decent-looking (I have not taken it myself) 30 minute course in LaTeX which you can find [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes).

## How to use
Start by opening ``report.tex``, and compile via your method of choice. From there insert any template fields that are denoted by ``<>``.

By default, some lines are commented out, such as ``\input{./abstract.tex}``. If you wish to use the line, ensure that they are commented out before continuing

From there, go to each individual ``.tex`` file and get started with your report!
